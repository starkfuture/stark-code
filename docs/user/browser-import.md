# Import browser sessions

The desktop app can import cookies from another browser so you can reuse its signed-in sessions
in your **Personal imported sessions** profile. Agents cannot open this profile or any other
personal profile. They use a separate **Agent browser** whose sessions are discarded when the app quits.

During setup, choose **Browser** after connecting your agents. Your default browser is selected
when it is recognized. Choose **Review import**, select the source profile and the
sites to copy, then confirm the warning and choose **Import**. No sites start selected.
Only the exact selected cookie domains are copied; a parent domain is a separate
choice because its cookies can sign you into multiple subdomains.

To import later, open **Settings → Integrations → Browser profiles →
Add profile**, then choose a browser under **Import from**. Close the source browser before
importing, and allow an operating-system keyring unlock prompt if one appears.
Imports always go into Personal imported sessions, regardless of the current default profile.

This is a one-time copy. Later login changes stay separate between the two browsers, and some
sites may still require you to sign in again.
Saved passwords, bookmarks and browsing history are not imported.

On macOS, Zen profiles are supported alongside Firefox. Only the default container's cookies
are copied; separate container logins remain in the source browser.

Existing imported sessions stay in their personal profiles after an update and
remain unavailable to agents. Before an agent reads or acts on a site in Agent
browser, approve that site's origin in the browser panel or native app prompt.
That permission does not copy any sessions from Personal imported sessions. Closing the
agent tab or clearing its cookies ends the permission.

On macOS, Safari imports need Full Disk Access. Choose **Allow**, drag Stark Code into the
System Settings permission list, and turn access on. **Continue** becomes available when access
is detected. macOS may require you to quit and reopen Stark Code before the grant applies; reopen
the import wizard afterward. You can revoke Full Disk Access once the import is done.

On Windows, import supports Firefox and Helium profiles that use standard profile encryption.
Other Chromium-based browsers use app-bound encryption and cannot be imported. Partitioned cookies
are skipped on all platforms.

Session imports require a packaged build with cookie encryption and an available OS keyring.
Development builds can show available browsers and sites, but cannot import sessions.
Ordinary browsing remains available.
